/*
    Constants & Variables

    Constants are values that cannot be changed once set, while variables can be modified after their initial assignment. In Swift, constants are declared using the `let` keyword, and variables are declared using the `var` keyword.

    This example demonstrates how to declare constants and variables of different data types, including String and Int. It also shows how to change the value of a variable after its initial assignment.
